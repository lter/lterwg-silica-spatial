Dataset_Abstract,"ABSTRACT.This is a summary of major ion concentrations for stream water samples collected at the Albion site, at the lower end of Green Lakes Valley at the road crossing (culvert) at the Albion camp."
Dataset_Methods,"Data for 1982-1991 were originally provided by Nel Caine as space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet and the later data sets were provided by the Kiowa Lab manager in space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet. The 2 formats differed in terms of units, number of columns, and column order.; The times at which samples were collected were not provided in the data for 1982-1991, although some of this information could be retrieved from the original field notebooks of Nel Caine. Similarly, charge balances were not provided with the earlier data but could be calculated from the other data.; The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum).; Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero.; A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that the Cl concentration for 911226 ""seems unusually low.""; The following 2 records were included in the file containing the 1992 data and represent redetermination of 2 1991 samples. A portion or all of these data may or may not ultimately be used to replace the original determinations. Column formats are identical to those described in the header section below:; ALBION,911031,1220,6.99,27.00,127.99,0.10,,190.62,19.74,37.84,8.95,5.75,17.22,91.82,35.68,257.26,242.78,0.03; ALBION,911226,1415,7.33,47.20,284.49,0.05,,322.60,54.79,77.43,11.76,6.80,16.93,121.07,115.08,466.63,429.29,0.04; A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that the ""ANC seems very low and Cl extremely low"" for the 930805 sample. The analyses were repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided an ANC of 47.70 uS/cm and a Cl concentration of 69.92 ueq/L.; A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that ""Cl is high here"" and ""contaminated?"" for the 931111 sample. The analysis was repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided a Cl concentration of 27.81 ueq/L.; Total and dissolved N and P were measured beginning in 1994. ""Empty"" columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format.; Particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as PO4--- were measured beginning in 1996. Some of these parameters had been measured on several of the 1995 samples, so all the data for 1995 were reprocessed to include these measurements and ""empty"" columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format.; The the sample bottles for the first records for 941013, 941027, 941124, 941222, and 941229 were soaked in 10% HCL solution, while the sample bottles for the second records for these dates were soaked in Deionized water.; A note on the laboratory print out indicated that the sample for the first record for 941124 was contaminated with K+ and CL-.; A note on the laboratory print out corresponding to the 960306 record said ""High concentrations in this sample are probably good. Very low flow volume with ground water"".; The sampling site is at 3250 m elevation and represents a drainage area of 709.7 ha.; Dissolved organic C was measured starting in 1998. Total organic C and particulate organic C were measured starting in 2002.; Delta 18O was measured starting in 1998. Units were originally reported as ""ppm"", but the correct units are ""per mill"" as confirmed by Chris Seibold (17 November 2011). Delta deuterium, the standard deviations of delta 18O and delta deuterium values, and deuterium excess were measured starting in 2007.; The missing value indicator is one of the following codes:; DNS=Data Not Submitted; EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits; N/A=Not Applicable; NP=Not Performed; NSS=No Sample Submitted; NV=Not Valid; QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient; Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero prior to 2007 and ""u"" subsequently.; Note: Columns for acidity, alkalinity, tritium, total organic C, and particulate organic C are present in the data set for consistency with other stream water chemistry data sets. Measurements for these variables were not performed for this data set.; CITATIONS:; [1]Caine, N., E.M. Thurman, D.J. Furbish, and T.A. Moses. 1983.
